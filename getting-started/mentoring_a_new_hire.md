# Mentoring a New Hire

by Jen Luker and Shaine Hatch

You will be the first experience that this new employee will have at Nav. Keep in mind that you’re representing Nav, your organization and your team. This will likely be the most memorable experience for them at Nav, and it’s your responsibility to make it a good memory.

## Expectations

### Prepare for their arrival

- What day will they start?
- When will they have their equipment?
- How will we meet?
  - In person?
  - Zoom?
- Will they have access to the systems?

Answers to these questions will come from the hiring manager. As you review the onboarding schedule you’ll see the Pre-Onboarding steps that happen in preparation for their first day. It is expected that you will make sure they are invited to the meetings listed in the https://navinc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/1495793708. Work with their manager if they need to be added to any meetings.

### Help them Create a Plan

> “If you Fail to Plan, You are Planning to Fail” – Benjamin Franklin

It’s important that the mentor and mentee have goals and a plan for growth. One way to do that is with a 30/60/90 plan. We have created a 30/60/90 Template that you can use. This is a tool that you can use to help build the plan. Not all personalities will work well with something this detailed. In some cases it can create a lot of anxiety and stress. Be aware of that and shape the plan accordingly. Work with your leadership team to help determine other ways to create and track the plan.

### Tribe/Discipline Onboarding Playbook

Find time during the first week (usually their 2nd day) to go over the information specific to their Tribe/Discipline. You can find the playbooks specific for that in the Engineering Onboarding Playbook Section 3

### Team Onboarding Playbook

Take them through the playbook specific to their team, if one exists. If one doesn’t, then start one together. This should introduce them to their backlog, the way that the team works, estimates and communicates.

### Have a project ready for them to work on

Have a project ready for them to work on. This could be appropriate tasks from the backlog, or it could be pairing with you on the work that you are assigned.

### Have them present on their work

We have bi-weekly company demos. Help them to prepare a demo for the work that they have completed during their first days/weeks at Nav.

### Encourage them to ask questions

Help them to understand how code is delivered on the team. Allow them to spend some time working on tasks and check on them often to see if they have any questions. It can be hard for them to feel comfortable asking questions at the start. Listen carefully and respectfully to all their questions and answer them sincerely. Remember that you’re responsible for setting them up for success. This is an opportunity for you to see your company through fresh eyes.

### Review Company Jargon with them

As is the case in most companies, we have developed a bit of our own language here at Nav. Take them through the https://navinc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GSAN/pages/1314488533 and help them feel comfortable with the language their going to be hearing each day.

### Update the onboarding docs

The onboarding documents, including this one, are only as good as we make them. As you spend time going through them, take the opportunity to improve them. Fix where there are mistakes, add to them where you find information that can benefit those future employees.

## Introduce them to the Company

Take the time as you’re working and bring the new employee up to speed at Nav to introduce them to people at the company. Who does the design work, who are our engineering, product and marketing leaders? Bring them into some of your networks to help them become acclimated with Nav quickly.

Week 1

- Onboarding into the company

Week 2

- Onboarding into their code bases

Week 3

- Pairing sessions and helping your mentee find the appropriate resources/people (Especially if it is a cross team mentorship)

First 30 days

- Familiar with their team

  - A method a mentor can employ is to devise a “20 questions game” with their mentee. However, it’s important that the questions in place aren’t all work related. Mentors should take the opportunity to better understand their mentee (and vice versa) by asking more personal questions or even asking what their “work love language is”.

    - Words of Affirmation = Feedback + Mentorship
    - Quality Time = Workplace Bonding
    - Receiving Gifts = New Opportunities + Challenges
    - Acts of Service = Support
    - Physical Touch = Encouraging Touchpoints

First 60 days

First 90 days

## Expectations about relationship

- What is the level of effort expected before requesting help?
- How much time is committed to the relationship?
- Who must be prepared with what before discussions?
- How should we expect to work together? (Pairing etc)
- How much time should we set aside to dedicate to meeting, how often?
