<h1>Engineering Design Principles</h1>

The 5-minute clip at the beginning of this video is absolutely worth watching. Elon Musk explains the Engineering design Principles, and how they apply to building rockets.

<h2>Engineering Design Principles:</h2>
1) Make your requirements less dumb
    a) Your requirements ARE dumb. In fact, it is even more dangerous if the requirements come from someone highly skilled.
2. Delete the part or process. 
    a. Don’t build things that aren’t problems in the first place
3. Simplify or Optimize 
    a. If you aren’t having to add requirements back in, you’re not deleting enough
4. Accelerate cycle time 
    a. Don’t dig your grave faster. Stop digging your grave!
5. Automate 
    a. The very LAST step when the ROI makes automation worthwhile. 
    b. Don’t automate things that shouldn’t exist.

Nav has a set of https://navinc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/785219629 that incorporate these concepts and layer on how we expect to do these things together.

<h2>How do these principles correlate to Software Engineering lifecycles?</h2>

These questions are similar to Planning and Design documents such as the PSL, Solution Architecture Summaries (SAS), and ADR. 

<h2>Questions to answer when considering designing a new project</h2>
* What is the problem we are trying to solve?
* Do we have data to support that this problem exists, needs solving, and needs solving now?
* How does this idea solve this problem?
* Do we have data to support that this idea is the right solution?
    * How long will it take to see the Return On Investment (ROI)?
    * Is it more cost-effective to patch the acute problem, or to solve the underlying issue?
* What is the MVP (Minimum Viable Product)? What is the MDP(Minimum Delightful Product)?
    * Minimum Viable Product
        * The tiniest prototype possible. Ugly, barely functions. Proof of concept.
        * If you aren’t having to add requirements back in, you aren’t deleting enough.
    * Minimum Delightful Product
        * The smallest product where the customer finds it less frustrating to use than to not use it. 
        * Releasable to customers (internal or external)
