<h1>Holistic Approach to Leadership</h1>

People often seek out mentors to help them develop a specific aspect of their career, but as mentors, we need to recognize that we are mentoring people, not just that specific aspect. When work is stressful, home is impacted. Conversely, when home is doing well, work may be particularly productive. 

Understanding how the whole person is faring prevents mentors from doing more harm than good.

Developing the relationship is the most important aspect of a mentor’s job. Just like a therapist, if the relationship is developed when life is good, when life isn’t good, the trust exists to confidently share and confront the challenges as they come. Addressing issues early, and often, keeps any of them from becoming too big to be insurmountable. That can’t happen, effectively, without trust in the relationship. 

If a mentor focuses only on the specific aspect, like a programming language or technology, then the mentee will only approach them with that specific aspect. Instead, they'll see it as part of their job and overwhelm themselves trying to fulfill the required tasks. They may not be willing to say "I'm stressed out about this thing at home, so I don't think I can take on the homework this week." They may not say, “I’m already overwhelmed by the complexity of this other ticket. Can you pair with me on it instead of what we had planned?”

 Understanding the capabilities and load of the person enables mentors to set reasonable expectations, coach them through difficult times, cheer them through good times, and work together to achieve the desired growth. Sometimes, it is more important to spend a 1:1 giving space for the mentee to vent about their worries about their family member’s health than to teach a new concept. Occasionally, the lesson is the distraction a mentee needs to take a break from home. Rarely, a mentor needs to point out that a mentee is harming their career due to a poor work and life balance and/or condition, and help the mentee and their manager identify a path moving forward to recuperate and recover. 

We are familiar with the concept that mentors can encourage a mentee when they are going through a rough patch, but an aspect that is overlooked in mentorship is helping the mentee understand that nobody can maintain peak performance for long. Going above and beyond is great, but if you maintain it for too long, it stops being above and beyond, and becomes the expected level of performance. It is not only okay, but healthy, to be “average” with periods of highs and lows. Slow and steady wins the race. 

Mentorship is a powerful tool. If we consider the mentee as a whole person, mentors can act as teachers, coaches, advocates, supporters, cheerleaders and sponsors. Mentors and mentees will both grow from the relationship.
