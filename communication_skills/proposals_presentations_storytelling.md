- Define the one sentence you want everyone to remember after the presentation is over.
  - Write this down on a sticky note, and keep it front and center when designing slides
  - If the information doesn’t directly correlate with that sentence, or move the story forward, delete it
- Groups of 3
  - Humans can only remember a max of 5 things at a time, with the ideal number being closer to 3
  - Have no more than 3 main points with no more than 3 sub-points.
- Add your data sources and references to the presenter notes
  - You don’t need to put them on the screen. This will help you access that data easily when questions are asked, but save space on the slides, and audience mental capacity for more important info.

## Template for Formulating a Presentation Proposal

[PDF Template - Formulating a Proposal]([media/[template]_formulating_a_proposal.pdf](https://github.com/knitcodemonkey/processes/blob/master/media/%5Btemplate%5D_formulating_a_proposal.pdf))

- “The problem I intend to solve”
- How we viewed this in the past
- “Following my analysis, this is why I would approach solving the problem differently.”
- “I will work with teams to...”-my plan; how I intent to solve the problem
- “I would recommend...“-my requirements for this being successful and approachable
- Benefits/wins/how this positions the company

## The Model, Document, Share Approach

From [An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management](https://navinc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/2685435985), this approach is useful for testing ideas and socializing approaches in a way that allows other teams to opt into learning from you. It optimizes for getting things right over doing them quickly, and as such is less useful for mandating practices to teams, which typically wants speed with a reduced focus on pinning down exactly the right practices. Read the original article here: [Model, document and share.](https://lethain.com/model-document-share/)

### Model

Identify a gap in your team that you want a new tool or process to solve. Try to create a baseline metric illustrating where you are today, which you’d like to improve. Adopt the practice or tool in your team, taking care to watch your metric for improvements. Give your experiment enough time to prove itself, but pay attention to what matters and revert the experiment if you’ve collected enough information that suggests that it’s not helping.

### Document

Write up, in detail, the problem you had, how you approached your adoption and test, and the steps that other teams ought to follow to also adopt. Ask members of other teams to review the document for understandability.

### Share

Share your document and experiences with others in some sort of public fashion. Let the appropriate people know about it, but do not ask anyone else to adopt it or lobby for the organization at large to mandate it. What worked for you may be a poor fit for other areas of the business. If others see the same constraints in their world that you saw in yours, they’ll be eager to learn from your approach.
