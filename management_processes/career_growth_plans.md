Creating a career growth plan is a conversation that happens between a manager and their employee more than a spreadsheet or document you fill out. The following description is only one way to create such a plan.

# Description
Career Growth plans focus on just that: the career of the employee. Their career could have started before this job, and will likely continue beyond this job. You can use the projects for this job to help them practice and grow into those career skills, but the focus should be on the career growth, not job growth. The goal of this plan is to help the employee identify areas of strength and growth, uncover hidden talents, and define what they want their future trajectory to go. All of this is subject to change as your employee grows, so redo the evaluation frequently, quarterly or semi-annually is best.

# Open questions

The questions in these categories are meant as examples for you to pick and choose from. They, in essence, ask the same question, but different people need different versions of the question to dig deeper. Leave the question as open as possible to encourage the employee to think beyond a bulleted list.

## Growth:

- When you say, “I want to grow,” what does that mean to you?
- What is your personal definition of growth?
- How do you prefer to receive feedback, and how often would you like to receive it to support your growth?

## Strengths:

- What do your coworkers come to you for?
- What kinds of questions do people come to you to ask?
- What are your favorite parts of your job?
- What skills do you have that this company isn’t taking advantage of?
- What skills have you learned in previous positions that I, your manager, may not be aware of?

## Weaknesses:

- When asked to take on a body of work, which ones immediately make you uncomfortable?
- What skills do you admire in your coworkers?
- What is the weakness that gives you the most imposter syndrome?
- What sort of tasks do you struggle with?
- For which kinds of skills require you to rely on your coworkers?

## Broad or Wide T

This category is meant to help you determine whether an employee’s curiosity encourages them to be more interested in a broad array of topics, or to dig deeply into one topic. The goal is to have a balanced T. We do not want our employees spreading themselves too thin, or becoming a “jack of all trades, master of none.” We also don’t want our employees to be buried so deep that they are unable to adapt to new technology as the ecosystem evolves.

- Do you think you have a wider or deeper T?
- Are you more interested in your primary specialty focus (frontend, backend, devops, platform services, etc.), or in learning the skills required of other positions?

# Skill Level Rubric

The Individual Development Plan attached was put together by [Gian Perrone](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gianp/), and is just an example of such a document.

[Career Growth Plan - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e2Urgj6pJX5VIR-E_W-uI7yfwQSuvtESWH3xKbPMvPg/edit?usp=sharing)

1. Create a new spreadsheet, or a new tab in the spreadsheet if it already exists, and rename the tab with today’s date
2. Transfer applicable skills and levels from the template rubric to their own spreadsheet.
  1. If they were recently promoted, have them copy just the level they are at
  2. If they are working towards a promotion, have them also copy out the skills for the level above them

3. For the employee:
  1. Complete the self evaluation for the level and level n+1
  2. Explain why in the notes column for rows marked Uncomfortable and Confident
  3. Brainstorm ways to practice in rows marked Uncomfortable

4. For the manager:
   1. Provide your rating, add any notes, and schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss any divergences, and define the plan

5. Together:
   1. Review the employee’s evaluations, and how they may diverge from the manager’s evaluations
   2. Review the brainstormed ideas for how to practice the skills where growth is needed
   3. Commit to development actions and timelines

6. Note: You can really only focus on one or two development areas at a time. Prioritize and discuss what is achievable

You will notice the spreadsheet does not use the Does Not meet / Meets / Exceeds language. People can only gauge the skill level of others compared to their own, but they can’t judge where they are in their own level. Instead, the document uses Uncomfortable / Comfortable / confident language. People are far more capable of evaluating their comfort level than they are their level.

For skills they mark either Uncomfortable or Confident , have them fill out the Notes/Reasoning/Evidence column. For Uncomfortable, you will likely get explanations as to what part of the statement makes them uncomfortable, or a better understanding of what they think that task entails. For Confident, you will get examples of work they’ve done that has required these skills.

For those areas marked Uncomfortable, have the employee fill out the column for Brainstorm ways to practice. Allowing them to brainstorm ideas will help you identify goal types they are more likely to buy into. If an employee has difficulty sitting down long enough to read a whole book, assigning them a book to read is likely not going to be a goal they will accomplish. We want to set up our employees for success, not for failure.

# Final note
The employee should own their own career growth spreadsheet. that way it can travel with them as they move between managers, or even jobs. Each new manager can see the growth and goals that the employee has been working towards without having to start over from scratch.

As the employee is performing most of the work, it teaches them how to set up a growth plan for themselves. Adding a new tab for each review allows them to see their growth over time. This can be a big motivator for an employee that has struggled to see that growth in the past.
