# Bullet Journaling for ADHD and Work
Created by Jen Luker

## Premise
TikTok Video: [How 1 day turns into a week](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM87kaTwF/)

I'm going to put this out there. I've got ADHD. Executive function issues are no joke. It can feel like an uphill battle trying to fit my neurodivergent brain into a world that isn't made to work with my brain. When it comes to time management, focus, and staying on task, everyone will tell you their favorite note-taking apps. I have tried a multitude of digital note-taking and to-do apps, but as soon as the tab is closed, or the window makes it into the background, it might as well not exist.

A physical notebook that I can touch, see, and takes up space on my desk means that it is never out of sight, or out of mind. Typing is in one ear and out the fingers, but somehow skips my memory. The process of writing dramatically increases the chances I’ll remember what I wrote over anything I type.

In this article, I have detailed some of the philosophies and visual language queues that works for me. Bullet Journaling is what you make it, so make it your own!

## Instagram does not define bullet journaling

[Bullet Journal - Learn the system](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn)

Many people hate the idea of a bullet journal, but I believe that is because the first image that comes to mind is a gloriously decorated book filled with calligraphy, art, and a little bit of actual note-taking.

Though beautiful layouts are one way to use a bullet journal, so is the minimalistic approach. **Remember that the system is supposed to adapt to you, not you to the system.**

I have gone through several types of spreads in the years I’ve been bullet journaling. Depending on my needs, I’ve used schedule-based, checklist-based, and journaling-based layouts. Some have been prettily decorated. Others have been chicken scratch and scribbles. Whatever I needed at the time is “the right way.”

## Why I don’t separate my work and home bullet journals
I am a whole person. I have work. I have family. I have struggles, life events, and work stress. No matter how hard I try to divide my life into neat boxes, they still influence each other. Stress at home may result in distracted and low productivity at work. Getting praised at work may result in a fancier dinner. Sleep, mood, and how well I take care of myself and those that depend on me are influenced by my whole self, not just my work self or home self. 

By keeping all parts of my life in one book, I can better analyze why I had a rough work week, or why I’m feeling especially exhausted at the end of the day. It can also help me see the patterns behind high work productivity and positive family interactions. 

Separate books means more chances to lose both the books and the context. The more things I have to track, remember, and associate, the less likely it is that it will be tracked, remembered, or associated. One person, one life, one book.

## Ritual is a shortcut for getting into the zone

> _Creative flow_ is the experience of being completely immersed, present, focused and _in the zone_. The inner critic and mental chatter are quieted, novel ideas are born, and random associations collide.

> When inspiration is elusive, _ritual_ appears to offer a shortcut to _creative flow_.
> 
> ~ Rex Jung, neuropsychologist

The act of preparing my bullet journal for the next block of information, whether it be a 1:1, checklist item, or notes, is a ritual that prepares my mind for what is to come. I consider it an act of respect to give my undivided attention to the person or task at hand. Though it may seem insignificant to jot down my thoughts for what I’m putting down, and write down the date for the upcoming task or event, it is ritual nonetheless. The space for creative flow to occur has been created. The focus has been defined.

## Focus and Invading Ideas

| ![Carried away by all those thoughts and ideas you don’t want to forget](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1584489/148611142-26dd416d-9d18-4885-aa04-19101eb97a5b.png) |

| <b>How many strings of thought can you hold onto before you are carried away?</b>|



It happens to all of us. A great idea pops into my head that I don’t want to forget. I may keep working, but I’m also now trying to constantly remind myself about this idea. I’m no longer focused on the task at hand. Less focus means more bugs, and fewer chances for my mind to come up with good ideas. It doesn’t take too many thoughts I want to hold onto before I’m no longer working on the task at all. In fact, I may be half way down a 12-hour rat hole before I even realize what has happened. Writing down those ideas in my bullet journal is a way I can let go of those balloon strings, and stay in the zone on my work. 

If I have decided that the idea is worth pursuing, I use either my phone timer or an egg timer to time-box my research for the day. “I’ll give myself an hour, then I’ll write down what I’ve discovered, and get back on task.” The timer enforces the time limit, because our brains are horrible at keeping track of frivolous things like time.

## Visual Language

### Date and @name entries, notes, 1:1s

Write down the date, and person who inspired you to put this thing down on paper
Dating and @naming my entries has been one of the most powerful uses of my bullet journal. I can go back to an entry to identify when something happened so that I can then go back to those dates in Slack to find the rest of the notes, context, or any other info I missed. 

### Linked lists
I use linked lists most often for 1:1s and even some checklist items. 

#### 1:1s example
On my collections page, I will mark the first page I wrote down a 1:1 with Jen, then on each 1:1, I’ll include the linked list as part of the title.

```
1:1 w/Jen - 1/7/2022.     ← 73     86 → 
```

In this title, I know I’m having a 1:1 with Jen, what day that 1:1 was held, and both the previous page (73) and next page (86) I can find 1:1s with Jen. If I start from the beginning of the book, I can follow those arrows all the way through to find every 1:1 I’ve had with Jen without having to search through every page. If I start from my last entry into my bullet journal, I can flip back to the most recent 1:1 with Jen and follow the path backwards to get context for our previous few conversations. 

#### Checklist item

- [ ] Write confluence doc about bullet journaling   ← 55

In this item, I know I have previously written notes for it on page 55. I can go back to read those notes without having to write them over again every time. 

- [ ] Write confluence doc about bullet journaling   ← 55, 57, 65

Though I could use a linked list to keep track of all the notes, sometimes I just need a list of pages. This indicates that I’ve made notes on these pages, and I can copy that list of pages each time I move the checklist item forward to another page/day. It just keeps track of the notes, not the checklist items.

If it is a long-running project, then I will add the page(s) to my Collections page at the beginning of the book. Collections are like Jira epic items for my bullet journal, while an index is like the roadmap. 

### Color-coding
Color-coding runs pretty deep through my bullet journals. 

#### Travel: 
Green Highlighting. I mimic this throughout my book for highlighting monthly calendars, day titles, and any notes I may keep about that travel. 

Speaking of travel, I make sure to write down the flight info, hotel and job site addresses and phone numbers, rental car company info, etc. so that if my phone dies, is lost, or stolen, I can still function. This may err on the side of paranoia, but I’d rather have the info and not need it than need it and have no way of getting it. This actually came in handy, recently, when I traveled overseas. Getting through the international security checkpoints was a breeze because all the info the security officer needed about my travel plans was all neatly written down ahead of time. He just had to copy it out of my book!

#### Blocks of text: 

Journaling Layout: Each day has its own color. It makes it easy for me to see the break in thoughts throughout the pages. 

Meetings and 1:1s: Each meeting has its own ink color. The process of selecting the pen, writing down the title, and including any info I know I need to cover helps me transition my thoughts into the 1:1. This is especially helpful when I’m having to stop working on a project to hold the meeting or 1:1. It gives me the initiative to write down any thoughts regarding the project so I can let them go and switch pen colors. To prepare for the upcoming meeting, I review the notes from the last meeting, and mark the linked-list numbers. Getting in the zone expands beyond code, and into any work you are doing.

#### Q&A: 

Questions have different colors than the answers so I can break the info into their Q&A pairs. 

#### Borders and Horizontal Rules:

If, for some reason I do have several topics in the same color, such as a meeting covering several items, drawing boxes or horizontal rules in a color helps be break up the info into their specific topics. The color pops out, so I can see the most important notes on the page. If a collection has a matching color, it can also help remind myself to add that block to a collection’s list of pages.

#### The book itself:

Most of my house is in a navy blue, black, or white. If my bullet journal is black, it will disappear into the recesses of my house. For this reason, my most important items tend to be bright red: my phone case, my bullet journal, the strap on my keys. For someone who can walk a straight line from point A with something in my hand, to point B without it, a brightly colored item is easier to find.

## Supplies suggestions

These links are mostly to Amazon for convenience. Buying local is always best.

### Notebooks

I use specific ones made for fountain pens, but if you’re not that particular, I love these in dotted format:

#### A5 Notebooks (~5¾ inches by 8¼ inches)

- [Leuchtturm1917 Dotted Notebook](https://www.amazon.com/Leuchtturm1917-Medium-Dotted-Hardcover-Notebook/dp/B002TSIMW4)

#### A6 Notebooks (~3.5 inches x 5.5 inches)

- [Spiral-bound dotted notebook](https://www.amazon.com/Yansanido-Notebook-Notebooks-Journals-Planner/dp/B08SJH1FP9/)
- [Moleskine Classic Notebook, Soft Cover, Pocket (3.5" x 5.5") Dotted](https://smile.amazon.com/Moleskine-Classic-Notebook-Softcover-8055002854627/dp/B01K03D8DM)

### Notebook Covers

Notebook covers can help keep your pens, notebooks, and stickers together. Also, functional, but not necessarily pretty, notebooks with a pretty cover will get used more than pretty notebooks that inspire one to pre-plan and write only pretty things down.

#### A5

- [Leather Zippered 10 Slots Pen Case with A5 Notebook Holder - Crazy Horse Brown](https://www.galenleather.com/collections/zippered-pen-pencil-cases/products/leather-zippered-10-slots-pen-case-with-a5-notebook-holder-crazy-horse-brown)
- [This shop](https://www.etsy.com/shop/SovaArtisanGoods) has notebooks that place the pen holder on the outside, which I used until I ended up with too many pens. [SovaArtisanGoods | Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/SovaArtisanGoods)

#### A6

- [Leather Zippered 5 Slots Pen Case - Crazy Horse Brown](https://www.galenleather.com/collections/leather-notebook-covers/products/leather-zippered-5-slots-pen-case-crazy-horse)

### Notebook features I look for:

- A5 size, though if that is too big, look at A6 size
- Dotted/Dot grid pages - I find grid lines and college rules are too visible and get in the way of the information and layout I need
- Has page numbers
- Binding preferences (spiral, lay-flat, hardbound, paperback)
- Bonus: Has bookmarks
- Bonus: Has index page
- Bonus: Has pen holder

### Pens
I use multiple pens with different ink colors to keep the information segregated and/or color-coded.
- [Micron pens](https://www.amazon.com/Sakura-Pigma-30062-Micron-Blister/dp/B0008G8G8Y/) in different weights for design elements.
- [Ultra-fine multicolored pens](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DV6EJ4I/) are a great option for color coding.
- [Midliner brush & pen markers](https://www.amazon.com/Zebra-Pen-Mildliner-Assorted-10-Count/dp/B07NDZRXT8/) for highlighting or breaking up info.

If multiple pens are too much, Multi-color or multi-function pens are a great option

- [Pilot Dr. Grip 4+1, 4 Color 0.7 mm Ballpoint Multi Pen & 0.5 mm Mechanical Pencil](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0788QVV5G/)
- [Multicolor Ballpoint Pen 0.5, 4-in-1 Colored Pens Fine Point](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08NHYS79B/)
- [Good Ole Fashioned BIC 4-in-1 Pen](https://www.amazon.com/BIC-4-Color-Ballpoint-Assorted-2-Count/dp/B00K0TRXJC/r)

### Stickers and Printouts

Stickers draw the eye, so they are great for helping identify important info or categories.
- [Calendar tab stickers](https://www.amazon.com/Calendar-Stickers-Monthly-Planner-Adhesive/dp/B08FSV626X)
- [Reusable/moveable tabs](https://www.amazon.com/Post-Writable-Repositionable-Dispenser-686-ALOPRYT/dp/B00NPCD8MW/)

### Misc Supplies

- [Skeleton Binder Clips](https://www.amazon.com/Eforlike-Hollow-Binder-Invoice-Supplies/dp/B01KWMG4LY/) let me clip my pages to lay them flat, but also allow me to see behind them

## Examples from my bullet journal over the years

### 2022

I'm continuing to use the Index and Collections spreads from 2019, while continuing my layouts from 2021. Bullet Journals don't need to be decorative to be functional.

### 2021

As a Senior Staff Engineer, my work changes from day to day. Some days I have checklists. Others are full of 1:1s and mentorship. Sometimes I am in planning and leadership meetings where notes need to be kept online for a wider audience. The complicated spreads still don't fit what I need. I moved to using stickers or printouts for calendars and visual resources, and checklist/journaling layouts for the rest.

| ![Checklists and Journaling](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1584489/148810394-053a9e19-28ff-4590-b3a7-edaf75abd7e1.jpg) | ![Little's Sketchbook](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1584489/148810380-ecf9ab87-fbde-4184-9ed3-81688c88adf8.jpg) |
|:--:|:--:|
| Example of a checklist and journaling spread | <b>Sometimes you (or your little) need a sketchbook</b> | 

### 2020
As my job shifted from management back into tech lead and IC, the elaborate spreads were no longer useful. They were left mostly blank. There are no images for this year because a lot of the book was journaling and checklists that included proprietary or personal info. This is the year where I got into fountain pens.

### 2019

My job, at the time, included a lot of meetings and 1:1s. Drawing out the weekly spreads on Sundays was a sort of mental preparation for my week.
