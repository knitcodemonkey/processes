Something that has worked for prior engineering teams is to have a channel in Slack where you can request a tour of some technology, process, etc. We have #dev-tours. The video is recorded, and added to a confluence doc with as many forms of documentation as possible. Transcripts, code snippets, explanations, links to additional resources, examples, etc.

- "Hey, so I need someone to show me __________." "Sure! Lets hop on zoom and record it to put in confluence!"
- Index page with subpages listing out each video/doc/article/external source

Phrases I live by:
> If someone asks a question, including yourself, answer the question with documentation. If the documentation doesn't exist, write the documentation, then answer the question with documentation.

Ideally, document together so that you both know that you both understand.

> Documentation is a love letter to your future self. And your past self in the form of new hires.

You'll appreciate it in 3 weeks when you've forgotten everything about this.

> Always be training your replacement. You can't get promoted, go on vacation, or expand your department if you don't leave documentation and training in your wake.

Video tours. Create/Edit Document together. Delegate teaching to others so that they learn it well enough to give the tour or write the docs or teach someone else.
