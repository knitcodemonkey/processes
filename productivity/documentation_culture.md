# How do you foster an internal culture of documentation?

Fostering a culture of documentation is not as easy as just telling people to document things. It often takes an active approach of leading by example, and assigning documentation to others that includes deadlines and progress follow-ups. There are a few main factors when it comes to a culture of documentation. 

> The search bar is the most important feature of your documentation.

If they can't find it, it doesn't matter how accurate it is. 

> The documents should be editable by everyone within the surrounding organizations.

The wider blast radius does mean there is an increased chance the doc will change in a way you can't predict, but that is also the goal. The documentation is there to serve those who need them; not those who wrote them. If the docs no longer serve their purpose, they should be edited, updated, or deleted with new docs taking their place. This takes more than one village to be done right. 


## The culture

### Phrases I live by, and repeat like a broken record:

> If someone asks a question, including yourself, answer the question with documentation. If the documentation doesn't exist, write the documentation, then answer the question with documentation.

Ideally, document together so that you both know that you both understand.

> Documentation is a love letter to your future self. And your past self in the form of new hires.

You'll appreciate it in 3 weeks when you've forgotten everything about this.

> Always be training your replacement. You can't get promoted, go on vacation, or expand your department if you don't leave documentation and training in your wake.

Video tours. Create/Edit Document together. Delegate teaching to others so that they learn it well enough to give the tour or write the docs or teach someone else. 

> Is there a doc for this? We should create one and work on it together if there isn't.

At first, people won't write docs because it won't be part of their process. This reminder is often all it takes to start that process. 


## The Documention

### How do I document things?

#### The verbose things

Something that has worked for prior engineering teams is to have a channel in Slack where you can request a tour of some technology, process, etc. We have #dev-tours. The video is recorded, and added to a confluence doc with as many forms of documentation as possible. Transcripts, code snippets, explanations, links to additional resources, examples, etc.

> "Hey, so I need someone to show me __________."
> "Sure! Lets hop on zoom for a walk-through, record it, and post it in confluence along with any notes you made!"

#### The more prescriptive or less verbose things
Another way is to add/edit documents together. When you find yourself either explaining, or asking someone to explain something, open up a doc where both of you can type out the notes. This allows the questioner to write out what they understand, and for the answerer to rephrase until clarity has been reached. This can include anything from vocabulary words and their descriptions, code snippets and examples, and explanations of how it works and why. 

### Organization

> So how do I organize all this stuff?!

Truth is, that is a hard question. You can sort your docs by action or by subject. Regardless of how you organize it, your docs should be searchable.

#### Action-based organization

The [Teleport docs](https://goteleport.com/docs/documentation-overview/) are a great example of action-based organization. This works well if the user already knows what they are trying to accomplish, but not the more specific details of what they need to accomplish it.

#### Subject-based organization

A great majority of documentation is written and organized based on the subject. This works well if you know the overview of what you need to do to accomplish the task, and just need to know the details for a particular subject. For instance, the [Datadog documentation guides](https://docs.datadoghq.com/all_guides/).

#### Searchable

Regardless of the option, it won't work for everyone. The most important key is that your docs are searchable. 

> What do you do if you search for a doc, can't find it, but someone else finds it and shares it?

Edit it, of course! Add the phrase you used to search for it so that you, and others, can find it again later.

> What if you find the doc, but it doesn't include enough information, is confusing, or is out of date?

Find someone who knows the subject well, and edit the doc together. Documents should be a living organism that is always evolving to include new, updated, and clearer details. Work together to edit the doc until you have both reached an understanding of the subject, and it now serves the purpose for which you needed it in the first place.
