<h2>Reverse Pyramid of basic coding principles</h2>

- The green `Make it work` row is version 1.0
- The blue section with the list of design principles is maintenance mode
- The grey `Make it fast` section is version 2.0
- The wider the row, the more time and energy you should invest. The order also matters. 

<h2>Don’t simplify something that shouldn’t exist</h2>

Don’t try to abstract before you know that your code works, doesn’t include extra complexity you don’t need, and has been broken down into its separation of concerns. Until then, you don’t know what abstractions you truly need. 

Though you can keep multiple design principles in mind as you code, don’t spend all your time refactoring the entire file when what you need to do is update one line of code.
